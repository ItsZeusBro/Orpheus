### Features:
1. Presentation objects should be worked on one at a time but orchastrated from above. A plugin should emphasize this workflow. 
2. Orpheus supports HTML, CSS, and Javascript code 
3. Abstract HTML and CSS Templates stay within the theme of Hydra, and should be the first thing you think about in a Hydra file
4. Associated Javascript is held within the same hydra context (the same file)
